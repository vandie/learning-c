Task 1.11 is a think task rather than a code task.
To test `example.c` I'd use a c test framework if one exists.

Obviously as the book is aimed to train anyone on usage of C, I doubt that's the answer that's wanted.

Actual Answer. You'd create a list of inputs to test and run the program against them all.
The program **will break** if you pass it non english characters. Say, hirigana katakana or kanji where words are not defined by spaces.
